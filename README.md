# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_for_Urban_Seismic_Noise
A convolutional autoencoder based deep embedded clustering implementation for seismic noise analysis. The code presented here is an example of one model training from mid-february. The project is ongoing as part of my master's research. The attached code does not represent the most current model or methods being utilized and will be updated as my research progresses. 

This research has been presented (or will be presented) at the conferences and workshops listed below.
