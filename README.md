# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_for_Urban_Seismic_Noise
A convolutional autoencoder based deep embedded clustering implementation for seismic noise analysis. The code presented here is an example of one model training from mid-february. The project is ongoing as part of my master's research. This research has been presented (or will be presented) at the following conferences and workshops.
